Singapore Resale Flat Prices Predicting
Welcome to the Singapore Resale Flat Prices Predicting project! This project focuses on predicting the resale prices of flats in Singapore using machine learning and deploying the model as an interactive web application. Here's a unique and creative overview of the project experience, tools used, and the approach taken.

Project Motivation
The highly competitive resale flat market in Singapore makes it challenging to estimate flat prices accurately. Various factors, such as location, flat type, floor area, and lease duration, influence resale prices. This project aims to develop a predictive model to provide users with estimated resale prices based on these factors, assisting both buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.

Skills Acquired
Data Wrangling: Collecting and preprocessing data for machine learning.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data distributions and relationships.
Model Building: Training and evaluating regression models.
Model Deployment: Creating an interactive web application for real-time predictions.
Domain
Real Estate
Problem Statement
Develop a machine learning model and deploy it as a user-friendly web application to predict the resale prices of flats in Singapore. This model will use historical data of resale flat transactions to assist potential buyers and sellers in estimating the resale value of a flat.

Tools Used
Python: For scripting, data preprocessing, and machine learning.
Streamlit: To build an interactive web application.
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn: For data manipulation and visualization.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning model development and evaluation.
Approach
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Collect resale flat transaction data from the Singapore Housing and Development Board (HDB) for the years 1990 to present.
Preprocess the data to clean and structure it for machine learning.
2. Feature Engineering
Extract relevant features such as town, flat type, storey range, floor area, flat model, and lease commence date.
Create additional features to enhance prediction accuracy.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize outliers and distributions using boxplots and distplots.
Use heatmaps to identify and drop highly correlated features.
4. Model Building and Evaluation
Choose a regression model (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forests).
Train the model on historical data and evaluate its performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² Score.
5. Streamlit Web Application
Develop a user-friendly web application using Streamlit.
Allow users to input flat details (town, flat type, storey range, etc.) and predict the resale price based on these inputs.
Ensure the model's feature engineering steps are applied to user input for accurate predictions.
6. Deployment
Deploy the Streamlit application on the Render platform to make it accessible to users over the internet.
7. Testing and Validation
Thoroughly test the deployed application to ensure it functions correctly and provides accurate predictions.
Results and Benefits
The project benefits both potential buyers and sellers in the Singapore housing market. Buyers can estimate resale prices and make informed decisions, while sellers can understand their flat's potential market value. Additionally, the project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in real estate and web development.
